- New content has been included in Annex 2, describing the calculation of a 15% limit on certain specified items related to investments in common shares of unconsolidated financial institutions, mortgage servicing rights, and deferred tax assets.
- The document outlines that the recognition of these items should not exceed 15% of the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital after all deductions have been applied.
- To determine the peak amount that can be accounted for, banks should multiply the CET1 by 17.65%. Important to remember that the actual recognized amount might be lower because of either the summed up three specified items being below the 15% limit or the application of a 10% limit to each item.
